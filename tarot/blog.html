<p>hello and welcome to the first entry in the aloe lonely tarot blog ! this is just a short introduction , the first post post is gonna be next week . so sometime in like spring 2020 i started doing a daily pull on my instagram , and it was kinda cool ... then i stopped for a little , then started again ... but it didnt feel the same , so i'm shaking up the format . now i'm gonna do one per week instead of one per day , and write them out here , instead of in instagram stories . this way it's easier to read , zoom in and stuff , screen readers can read it . and it's archived ! i'll still share it out over insta too . ok ! real one next week ! <3 &~*</p>
