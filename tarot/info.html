            <p>YATD is a tarot reading tool featuring an original 78-card <a href="pack.html">pack</a> , coded and illustrated by <a href="http://aloelone.ly">aloe lonely</a></p>
            <p>the illustrations are done after the work of pamela colman smith, with great gratitude and thanks to her</p>
            <p>YATD uses "true random" numbers derived from atmospheric noise provided by <a href="http://random.org">random.org</a> , with delight and appreciation .</p>
            <p>the diviniatory meanings and symbolic interpretations offered are excerpted from <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/pkt/index.htm">the pictoral key to the tarot</a> , by arthur edward waite , with gratitude and thanks to him also </p>
            <p>it must be noted that the pkt contains several interpretations clouded by misogyny , sexism and racism , and should be taken with a grain of salt , or its interpretations freely disposed of when necessary . passages have been included for their value as a starting-point and because the work is essentially linked with pamela colman smith's illustrations .</p>
            <p>YATD is free - if you love it and want to make a donation , aloe accepts them <a href="http://ko-fi.com/aloelonely">here</a></p>
