<h3>queen of pentacles</h3>
<p>you know, i picked this card a few days ago, and since then it's been just sitting on my desk, demanding a sort of quiet contemplation. and i think that actually speaks somewhat to the character of the card. it'll be said that the court cards sit kind of between the suits, after the cycle of pips of their own symbol is concluded, but before the next suit begins - not quite trumps, but named personages nonetheless - liminal cards, in more than one way. and in this framework where they're understood as a kind of transition or transformation, that transition can be taken to play out over the course of the four cards in order, through a successive picking-up, mastery, and use of their symbol enacted by our four players.
</p>
<p>all of which to say, the queen's part in this particular play is the "mastery" of her symbol, the total embodiment. our queen sits in a blooming field, wreathed in flowers, attended by a rabbit, and gazing in to her pentacle. unlike the page, caught enraptured by the sight of his pent while walking, starry eyed and in perpetual danger of tripping, the queen considers hers seated on a throne with a sober, nearly stern look - "<a href="http://aloelone.ly/tarot/cards/descs/76.html">the serious cast of intelligence,"</a> waite calls it. so here in the queens might be some of whatever we find lacking in our pages - in this case, a mastery of earth, of groundedness, of that quiet contemplation ... that steady sureness that allows her to gaze into the crystal ball without losing her footing.</p>
<p>as for taking a read on it, well, that all depends - if the page could be taken as a caution, i guess this could be a corresponding reassurance - that you'll have the fortitude to read the stars - or represent a person with that abiilty. great conjunctions coming up, and i know a lot of people just started their whole sign saturn returns, myself included. maybe this is too cohort-specific, or even just-me-specific, but ive been finding the need and want to take a lot of time to just contemplate, lately ... big big changes happened this year and are keeping happening, and big decisions take time. it makes sense to take like, as long as one could even need to just sit and contemplate right now. and we can handle what we see.</p>
