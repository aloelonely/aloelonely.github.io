update 04:23:21 - im moving the live version of this site to neocities ! neocities community is cool as heck multisite hosting is 5 dollars a month and github works with ICE ! ill leave the files here cause why not but i probably wont update them when i update stuff . bye !

(original readme)
this is my personal website ! it also has a little web app in it that does tarot card readings . it uses package node-random-org by user willfrew wrapping the random.org api to get true random numbers . the package is bundled by browserify because at the time i made the site i couldnt use node because i only had ftp access to my server , long story . its all written like trash because i didnt need to show it to anyone else but it works
