    <h1>you are inside the little house</h1>
    <h2>and you have approached the cactus</h2>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>it's vaguely spherical , succulent with short spines , barely a foot tall in its plain ceramic pot . before you can bend over to take a better look , the cactus starts to hum ! faint at first but becoming unmistakable , a harmonious whirr emenatates from the otherwise unassuming plant . </p>
    <p>as the hum spins up the cactus rises with its pitch through the very air , pot and all ! leveling out , it bobs comfortably in your eye line , sounding a pleasant little drone which modulates into a clear , if small , woman's voice . </p>
    <p class="cactus">once upon a time a witch lived here , watching the planets and doing her work . she leaves me behind to entertain curious travelers in her absence . welcome ! what would you like to do ?</p>
    looking around you do see a few bits of furniture which seem placed to invite your interest - a stack of cassette tapes beside their player on a table , an orderly bookshelf housing a disorderly collection of notebooks , a heavy leather-bound photo album and a door to the fenced-in backyard leaning slightly ajar . the cactus hovers and hums .<br/>
