    <div class="text">
    <p>you pose your question and the cactus makes a sound like a plant clearing its throat .</p>
    <p class="cactus">once upon a time a witch lived here , watching the planets and doing her work . she leaves me behind to entertain curious travelers in her absence . welcome ! what would you like to do ?</p>
    no matter what you say , the cactus replies with a carbon copy of this speech , like a tape in an answering machine . it looks like the witch has left her spell unfinished ! disappointed , you breifly entertain exploring the cabin without a guide , but quickly reconsider when your eyes turn to the plant's spines twirling thru the air and you recall the likely temperament of even friendly witches . in an abundance of caution you turn away , making a mental note to come back soon and see what has changed in this mysterious place .<br/>
